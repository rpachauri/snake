# snake
OpenAI Gym Environment for Snake

I created this project using the anaconda distribution. You can install it [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). If you prefer a lightweight version, you can [install Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/) instead.


Create the conda environment with:

    $ conda env create -f snake.yml

Activate the conda environment with:

    $ conda activate snake

Install the Snake environment with (note that the term "environment" is overloaded and we mean the RL environment in this case):

    $ pip install -e .

Go into the agents directory and run one of the agents:

    $ cd agents
    $ python monte_carlo.py
